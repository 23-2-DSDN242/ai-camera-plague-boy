For my project I intially wanted to look at manmade-vs-nature, training the AI to recognise man-made products, and structures, then my filter would warp these, but I found this to be too broad for the AI to understand.

In the end, I was inspired from the view from my flat, which features the typical Wellington Artchitecture, and the iconic houses sitting amongst bush. Coming from Auckland these houses symbolise to me Wellington's ability to work with nature, compared to many of Auckland suburbs that are more bland.

For my final filter, I decided to focus on the houses, inverting the colour and making it black and white, at the same time I wanted to warp the nature around, this is because I wanted to show how I see the houses in Wellington Hills, as a very standout feature of Wellington's architecture as a whole, as well I knew warpig the nature around you would still be able to recognise what it is.

A unexpected side effect of the warping was the warping of roads, because I only had the AI, and my own masks, focus on the houses, this meant the roads too warped, looking pretty normal in some results, and very odd in others, as the cars parked on the sides warped too.

Overall I am quite happy with the results of the project, if I had had more time I would have looked further at also pixelating the nature around the houses too, but I don't know if I would have been as happy with that outcome as I am with the current one.
